## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, proper type definitions
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Git workflow**: Feature branches with descriptive commit messages
- **Code review**: Self-review before deployment

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual testing**: Comprehensive user flow testing
- **Cross-browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile browsers  
- **Performance**: Lighthouse audits for each major feature
- **Security**: Basic penetration testing of auth flows

### Deployment Strategy
- **Staging**: Continuous deployment for testing
- **Production**: Manual deployment after staging validation
- **Database**: Migrations versioned and tested
- **Rollback plan**: Ability to quickly revert problematic deployments

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| BGG API downtime | High | Error states, cached fallbacks |
| Image storage costs | Medium | Compression, size limits |
| Database performance | Medium | Proper indexing, pagination |
| Authentication issues | High | Thorough testing, backup plans |

### Timeline Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| BGG API complexity | Medium | Start integration early, simple approach |
| Image upload bugs | Medium | Use proven libraries, extensive testing |
| Mobile responsiveness | Low | Mobile-first design approach |
| Scope creep | High | Strict adherence to PRD, no additions |
