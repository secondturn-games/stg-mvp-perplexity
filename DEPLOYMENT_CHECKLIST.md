## **ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan**

### **Immediate Rollback** (< 5 minutes)

If critical issues are discovered:

1. **Vercel Rollback**:

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard
   # Go to Deployments â†’ Click "Promote to Production" on previous stable deployment

   # Option 2: Via CLI
   vercel rollback https://your-previous-deployment-url.vercel.app --prod
   ```

2. **Verify Rollback**:
   - [ ] Check health endpoint
   - [ ] Verify critical functionality
   - [ ] Monitor error rates

### **Database Rollback** (If needed - 10-30 minutes)

If database changes cause issues:

1. **Identify Issue**:
   - Check Supabase dashboard logs
   - Review recent migration changes
   - Identify problematic migration

2. **Rollback Database**:

   ```bash
   # Create backup first
   supabase db dump --project-ref your-project-id > backup.sql

   # Reset to previous state
   supabase db reset --project-ref your-project-id

   # Apply migrations up to stable version
   supabase db push --project-ref your-project-id
   ```

3. **Verify Database State**:
   - [ ] Check all tables exist
   - [ ] Verify RLS policies active
   - [ ] Test authentication flow
   - [ ] Verify data integrity

### **Communication Plan**

- [ ] **Internal Team**: Notify via Slack/email immediately
- [ ] **Users**: Status page update if service affected
- [ ] **Stakeholders**: Brief summary of issue and resolution
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update incident log with lessons learned
